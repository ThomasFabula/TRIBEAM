Abstract

A resonant force sensor with semidigital frequency output based on a triple-beam resonator structure in 
silicon is presented. The piezoelectric excitation of the resonator operating in an antisymmetric vibration 
mode is realized by thin-film zinc oxide layers. An advantage of this triple-beam design is a high 
mechanical quality factor combined with high force sensitivity due to the antisymmetric vibration mode 
and the load-dependent stress concentration in the triple beam. Extensive finite-element modelling has 
been carried out to determine the static and dynamic behaviour and to obtain optimum sensor performance. 
Several resonator designs have been fabricated to study mechanical decoupling from the clamping region. 
Experimental characterization of the triple-beam sensor and of the zinc oxide thin-film properties 
has been performed.
